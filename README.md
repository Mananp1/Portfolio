# 🚀 Manan Patel's Portfolio

> **Full-Stack Developer | Problem Solver | Coffee Enthusiast ☕**

Welcome to my digital playground! This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and occasionally my sense of humor. Built with modern tech stack and deployed with love (and a bit of debugging).

## ✨ What's Inside

- **🎨 Modern UI/UX** - Clean, responsive design that works on everything from a smartwatch to a smart fridge
- **⚡ Lightning Fast** - Optimized for speed (because nobody likes waiting for websites to load)
- **📱 Mobile First** - Because let's face it, we're all glued to our phones
- **🎯 Contact Form** - Real email functionality (no more "contact me at" with a broken mailto link)
- **🔒 Secure** - Because security isn't just a buzzword around here

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 19** - Because we like living on the edge
- **TypeScript** - For when JavaScript just isn't strict enough
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS (because writing custom CSS is so 2010)
- **Vite** - Build tool that's faster than my coffee consumption
- **React Hook Form + Zod** - Form validation that actually works
- **Sonner** - Toast notifications that don't make you want to throw your computer

### Backend

- **Node.js + Express** - The dynamic duo of backend development
- **Resend** - Email service that actually delivers (unlike my jokes)
- **Rate Limiting** - Because spam is so last decade
- **CORS** - Cross-origin requests handled properly

### Deployment

- **Railway** - Deploy with a click (or several clicks, depending on your luck)
- **Environment Variables** - Because hardcoding secrets is a rookie move

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (because we're not savages using Node 12)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison)
- A sense of humor (optional but recommended)

## 🎯 Features

### ✨ Interactive UI
